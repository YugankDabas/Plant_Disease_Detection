# Plant_Disease_Detection
This is a web-based Plant Disease Detection System built using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on 38 classes of plant diseases. The system allows users to upload an image of a leaf, and it predicts whether the plant is healthy or suffering from a specific disease.
